# Movies-App
Movies App is my first project built with Appwrite as the backend. The application connects to the TMDB (The Movie Database) API to fetch detailed information about movies.

A key feature of this project is a simple algorithm that updates the list of trending movies based on user searches. Every time a user searches for a particular movie, its search count increases, which boosts its position in the Top 5 Trending Movies ranking displayed on the website. The more frequently a movie is searched, the higher it climbs in the trending list.
